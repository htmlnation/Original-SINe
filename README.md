# Original-SINe
This tiny HTA app is sort of a like screen saver you can tweak. This idea is old dating back to the C64 era.......sprites moving around in a sine wave.  I first used GIFs, which where amazingly fast......but it now uses slower &lt;DIVS> and a wingding character! This means I can colour, resize and change the wingding easily, adding lots of variance (at the price of speed)  There are 15 or so edit fields all except any type of number (long,single and negative). There are also a few edit fields with the word Eval() in the label. These will evaluate ANY expression you put in it! (like random, AND,OR etc). They can also use the variables from the mainloop (sprite index,X and Y), which can be used to make some beautiful or weird shapes\colours.  The code is commented and uncompressed because I submitted it elsewhere ;-). Just save it as a HTA and run it as usual.  Make sure you check out the favorites :-)
